# Introduction to Java

To run java scripts do the following: 

```
javac program.java
java program

```

Note that the class name must match the name of the program to avoid compilation issues

static : method can run without creating any instance of Main >> what does it mean precisely??

To declare a variable, say "i"

```
int i;
```

```if ... else``` implementation is same as in c++

## Arrays

For arrays use the following snippet

```
int[] array;
array = new int[size of the array];
```

## Loops 

same as c++

```
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {}
```

or 


```
while (condition) {}
```

## Functions

All functions must be within classes 

## Objects
